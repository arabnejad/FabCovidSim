# FabCovidsim
This is a FabSim3 /EasyVVUQ plugin for Covid-19 simulation


## Dependencies:

[FabSim3](https://github.com/djgroen/FabSim3.git) : `git clone https://github.com/djgroen/FabSim3.git`

[COVID-19 CovidSim microsimulation model developed Imperial College, London](https://github.com/mrc-ide/covid-sim)


## Installation
Simply type `fab localhost install_plugin:FabCovidsim` anywhere inside your FabSim3 install directory.

### FabSim3 Configuration
Once you have installed the required dependencies, you will need to take a few small configuration steps:
1. Go to `(FabSim Home)/deploy`
2. Open `machines_user.yml`
3. for `qcg` machine, add these lines
``` yaml
qcg:
  ...
  ...
  # setting for Imperial College COVID-19 simulator
  cores: 28
  budget: "vecma2020"
  # job wall time for each job, format P[nD]T[nH][nM]
  # nD - number of days, nH - number of hours, nM - number of minutes
  job_wall_time : "PT20M" # job wall time for each single job without PJ
  PJ_size : "2" # number of requested nodes for PJ
  PJ_wall_time : "PT50M" # job wall time for PJ
  modules:
    loaded: ["python/3.7.3", "r/3.6.1-gcc620"] # do not change
    unloaded: [] #
```
4. for `eagle_vecma` machine, add these lines
``` yaml
eagle_vecma:
  ...
  ...
  # setting for Imperial College COVID-19 simulator
  cores: 28
  budget: "vecma2020"
  # job wall time for each job, format Days-Hours:Minutes:Seconds
  job_wall_time : "0-0:20:00" # job wall time for each single job without PJ
  PJ_size : "2" # number of requested nodes for PJ
  PJ_wall_time : "0-00:50:00" # job wall time for PJ
  modules:
    loaded: ["python/3.7.3", "r/3.6.1-gcc620"] # do not change
    unloaded: [] #
```    
   <br/> _NOTE: you can changes the values of these attributes, but do not change the modules load list._
  
## Job submission via command line
1. To run a single job, simply type:
  >``` sh
  > fab <qcg/eagle_vecma> CovidSim:UK_sample[,memory=MemorySize][,label=your_lable]
  > ```   
  > _NOTE:_
  >   - by default **memory=20GB** .
  >   

2. To run the ensemble, you can type, simply type:
  >``` sh
  > fab <qcg/eagle_vecma> CovidSim_ensemble:UK_sample[,<memory=MemorySize>][,replicas=replica_number]
  > ```   
  > _NOTE:_
  >   -  **replicas=N** : will generate N replicas
  >    - if you want to run multiple simulations with different configuration, to do that, create your own folder name under `SWEEP` directory, and change the parameters files, there are some examples under `/config_files/SWEEP_examples` folder,
  >    - if you want to use QCG-PJ with `eagle_vecma` make sure that you first install it by `fab eagle_vecma install_app:QCG-PilotJob,virtual_env=True`
  >
  > _Examples:_
  >   -  `fab eagle_vecma CovidSim_ensemble:UK_sample`
  >   -  `fab qcg CovidSim_ensemble:UK_sample,PilotJob=True`
  >   -  `fab qcg CovidSim_ensemble:UK_sample,replicas=5,PilotJob=True`
  >   -  `fab eagle_vecma CovidSim_ensemble:UK_sample,PilotJob=True`
  >   -  `fab eagle_vecma CovidSim_ensemble:UK_sample,replicas=5`

## Running a standard EasyVVUQ - CovidSim campaign via Python

NOTE: As is stands now, everything below needs EasyVVUQ functionality present in the `dev` branch, so check out this branch first.

This demonstrates how to use a standard EasyVVUQ campaign on the CovidSim code. By 'standard' we mean non-dimension adaptive, where each input parameter is sampled equally. There are two Python scripts that need to be executed:

1. `standard_covid_easyvvuq/covid_init_SC.py`: a standard EasyVVUQ campaign up to and including job submission.
2. `standard_covid_easyvvuq/covid_analyse_SC.py`: job retrieval and post processing.

The `FabCovidSim` plugin is called from within `standard_covid_easyvvuq/covid_init_SC.py` via
``` python
import fabsim3_cmd_api as fab
fab.run_uq_ensemble(config, campaign.campaign_dir, script="CovidSim",
                    machine="eagle_vecma", PilotJob=True)
```
Here, `config` is the name of the config file directory that is used for the code, which are located in `config_files/`. Furthermore `script="CovidSim"` refers to `/templates/CovidSim`, which contains the instructions to execute a single job.

To retrieve the results from the remote machine, the following is executed in `standard_covid_easyvvuq/covid_analyse_SC.py`:
``` python
fab.get_uq_samples(config, campaign.campaign_dir, sampler._number_of_samples,
                   machine='eagle_vecma')
```

## Running a dimension-adaptive EasyVVUQ - CovidSim campaign via Python

The file `final_adaptive_covid_easyvvuq/covid_automated.py` contains the dimension-adaptive EasyVVUQ script that we used to produce the results of the following article:

Edeling, Wouter and Hamid, Arabnejad and Sinclair, Robert and Suleimenova, Diana and Gopalakrishnan, Krishnakumar and Bosak, Bartosz and Groen, Derek and Mahmood, Imran and Crommelin, Daan and Coveney, Peter, *The Impact of Uncertainty on Predictions of the CovidSim Epidemiological Code*, 2020.

We will go through the script step by step. First:

```python
output_columns = ["cumDeath"]
work_dir = '/home/wouter/VECMA/Campaigns'
config = 'PC_CI_HQ_SD_suppress_campaign_full1_19param_4'
ID = '_recap2_surplus'
method = 'surplus'
```

Here `output_columns` is a list containing the name of the column in the CovidSim output csv file that we use as our Quantity of Interest (QoI). Here we used the cumulative deaths. In a dimension-adaptive setting this list should contain only one QoI. The `work_dir` is where the EasyVVUQ Campaign will be stored, and `config` must match a directory name in the `config_files` directory of FabCovidSim. These config directories contain all the files needed to run CovidSim with at a specified setting. In particular, examine the `run_sample.py` file in these config directories. This file is responsible for passing the commandline parameters (seeds, R0 and ICU triggers) to CovidSim. We specify the seeds from within EasyVVUQ, and the other two are hard coded.

Above, `ID` is just a unique identifier that we use to save the state of EasyVVUQ, and `method` is the error method that we use in the dimension adaptive sampling. Here, the sampling plan is refined by using the hierarchical surplus.

Next we have

```python
    params = json.load(open(home + '/../templates_campaign_full1/params.json'))
```
This loads a JSON file with all CovidSim parameters

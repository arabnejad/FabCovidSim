# FabCovidsim
This is a FabSim3 plugin for Covid-19 simulation


## Dependencies:

[FabSim3](https://github.com/djgroen/FabSim3.git) : `git clone https://github.com/djgroen/FabSim3.git`

[COVID-19 CovidSim microsimulation model developed Imperial College, London](https://github.com/mrc-ide/covid-sim)


## Installation
Simply type `fab localhost install_plugin:FabCovidsim` anywhere inside your FabSim3 install directory.

### FabSim3 Configuration
Once you have installed the required dependencies, you will need to take a few small configuration steps:
1. Go to `(FabSim Home)/deploy`
2. Open `machines_user.yml`
3. for `qcg` machine, add these lines
``` yaml
qcg:
  ...
  ...
  # setting for Imperial College COVID-19 simulator
  cores: 28
  budget: "vecma2020"
  # job wall time for each job, format P[nD]T[nH][nM]
  # nD - number of days, nH - number of hours, nM - number of minutes
  job_wall_time : "PT20M" # job wall time for each single job without PJ
  PJ_size : "2" # number of requested nodes for PJ
  PJ_wall_time : "PT50M" # job wall time for PJ
  modules:
    loaded: ["python/3.7.3", "r/3.6.1-gcc620"] # do not change
    unloaded: [] #
```
4. for `eagle_vecma` machine, add these lines
``` yaml
eagle_vecma:
  ...
  ...
  # setting for Imperial College COVID-19 simulator
  cores: 28
  budget: "vecma2020"
  # job wall time for each job, format Days-Hours:Minutes:Seconds
  job_wall_time : "0-0:20:00" # job wall time for each single job without PJ
  PJ_size : "2" # number of requested nodes for PJ
  PJ_wall_time : "0-00:50:00" # job wall time for PJ
  modules:
    loaded: ["python/3.7.3", "r/3.6.1-gcc620"] # do not change
    unloaded: [] #
```    
   <br/> _NOTE: you can change the values of these attributes, but do not change the modules load list._
  
## Testing
1. To run a single job, simply type:
  >``` sh
  > fab <qcg/eagle_vecma> CovidSim:UK_sample[,memory=MemorySize][,label=your_lable]
  > ```   
  > _NOTE:_
  >   - by default **memory=20GB** .
  >   

2. To run the ensemble, simply type:
  >``` sh
  > fab <qcg/eagle_vecma> CovidSim_ensemble:UK_sample[,<memory=MemorySize>][,replicas=replica_number]
  > ```   
  > _NOTE:_
  >   -  **replicas=N** : will generate N replicas
  >    - if you want to run multiple simulations with different configuration, to do that, create your own folder name under `SWEEP` directory, and change the parameters files, there are some examples under `/config_files/SWEEP_examples` folder,
  >    - if you want to use QCG-PJ with `eagle_vecma` make sure that you first install it by `fab eagle_vecma install_app:QCG-PilotJob,virtualenv=True`
  >
  > _Examples:_
  >   -  `fab eagle_vecma CovidSim_ensemble:UK_sample`
  >   -  `fab qcg CovidSim_ensemble:UK_sample,PilotJob=True`
  >   -  `fab qcg CovidSim_ensemble:UK_sample,replicas=5,PilotJob=True`
  >   -  `fab eagle_vecma CovidSim_ensemble:UK_sample,PilotJob=True`
  >   -  `fab eagle_vecma CovidSim_ensemble:UK_sample,replicas=5`

## Running a standard EasyVVUQ
This demonstrates how to use a standard EasyVVUQ campaign on the CovidSim code. By `standard` we mean non-dimension adaptive, where each input parameter is sampled equally. To run this model, simply type
``` sh
fab eagle_vecma covid_init_SC:GB_suppress
``` 
This command will generate a `covid_standard_test` folder on your FabCovidsim plugin directory and saves all output campaign files and generated output figures in that folder. Then, submit an ensemble job to the remote machine.  
To analysis the results, first make sure that all submitted jobs are finished, then run this command which fetches results from the remote machine to your local PC and calls analysis function
``` sh
fab eagle_vecma covid_analyse_SC:GB_suppress
``` 
All figures and output files will be saved in `covid_standard_test` folder

> _NOTE:_ 
>   -  if you need to change the varied parameters, please modify `covid_standard.py` file
>   - each time that you execute `covid_init_SC` command, all folders and files in `covid_standard_test` directory will be deleted, so if you want to keep a track of your previous tests, please rename that folder or copy its contains in the another folder

## Running a dimension-adaptive EasyVVUQ
To run a dimension-adaptive campaign on the CovidSim code, please type the following commands :
``` sh
    fab eagle_vecma covid_init:GB_suppress
    fab eagle_vecma covid_analyse:GB_suppress
    loop
        fab eagle_vecma covid_look_ahead:GB_suppress
        fab eagle_vecma covid_adapt:GB_suppress

```

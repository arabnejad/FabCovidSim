# FabCovidsim
This is a FabSim3 plugin for Covid-19 simulation


## Dependencies:

[FabSim3](https://github.com/djgroen/FabSim3.git) : `git clone https://github.com/djgroen/FabSim3.git`

[COVID-19 CovidSim microsimulation model developed Imperial College, London](https://github.com/mrc-ide/covid-sim)


## Installation
Simply type `fab localhost install_plugin:FabCovidsim` anywhere inside your FabSim3 install directory.

### FabSim3 Configuration
Once you have installed the required dependencies, you will need to take a few small configuration steps:
1. Go to `(FabSim Home)/deploy`
2. Open `machines_user.yml`
3. for `qcg` machine, add these lines
``` yaml
qcg:
  ...
  ...
  # setting for Imperial College COVID-19 simulator
  cores: 28
  # job wall time for each job, format P[nD]T[nH][nM]
  # nD - number of days, nH - number of hours, nM - number of minutes
  job_wall_time : "PT20M" # job wall time for each single job without PJ
  PJ_size : "2" # number of requested nodes for PJ
  PJ_wall_time : "PT50M" # job wall time for PJ
  modules:
    loaded: ["python/3.7.3", "r/3.6.1-gcc620"] # do not change
    unloaded: [] #
```
4. for `eagle_vecma` machine, add these lines
``` yaml
eagle_vecma:
  ...
  ...
  # setting for Imperial College COVID-19 simulator
  cores: 28
  # job wall time for each job, format Days-Hours:Minutes:Seconds
  job_wall_time : "0-0:20:00" # job wall time for each single job without PJ
  PJ_size : "2" # number of requested nodes for PJ
  PJ_wall_time : "0-00:50:00" # job wall time for PJ
  modules:
    loaded: ["python/3.7.3", "r/3.6.1-gcc620"] # do not change
    unloaded: [] #
```    
   <br/> _NOTE: you can changes the values of these attributes, but do not change the modules load list._
  
## Testing
1. To run a single job, simply type:
  >``` sh
  > fab <qcg/eagle_vecma> CovidSim:UK_sample[,memory=MemorySize][,label=your_lable]
  > ```   
  > _NOTE:_
  >   - by default **memory=20GB** .
  >   

2. To run the ensemble, you can type, simply type:
  >``` sh
  > fab <qcg/eagle_vecma> CovidSim_ensemble:UK_sample[,<memory=MemorySize>][,replicas=replica_number]
  > ```   
  > _NOTE:_
  >   -  **replicas=N** : will generate N replicas
  >    - if you want to run multiple simulations with different configuration, to do that, create your own folder name under `SWEEP` directory, and change the parameters files, there are some examples under `/config_files/SWEEP_examples` folder,
  >    - if you want to use QCG-PJ with `eagle_vecma` make sure that you first install it by `fab eagle_vecma install_app:QCG-PilotJob,virtual_env=True`
  >
  > _Examples:_
  >   -  `fab eagle_vecma CovidSim_ensemble:UK_sample`
  >   -  `fab qcg CovidSim_ensemble:UK_sample,PilotJob=True`
  >   -  `fab qcg CovidSim_ensemble:UK_sample,replicas=5,PilotJob=True`
  >   -  `fab eagle_vecma CovidSim_ensemble:UK_sample,PilotJob=True`
  >   -  `fab eagle_vecma CovidSim_ensemble:UK_sample,replicas=5`
